# Admin Interface Investigation Notes

## Current Implementation State

### i18n Setup
- next-intl configured with en/ar locales
- Missing message files for translations
- Middleware handles locale-based routing
- Need to create messages directory with en.json and ar.json

### UI Components
- Basic shadcn/ui components implemented
- Missing DropdownMenu, Sheet, Avatar components
- Need to enhance sidebar with better styling
- Profile dropdown and user menu missing

### Permission System
- 403 error in permission creation due to missing 'manage_permissions'
- Admin needs proper permission assignment
- Role-based access control implemented but needs enhancement
- Need to improve permission checks in middleware

### Performance Issues
- API calls need optimization
- Role/permission queries can be improved
- Missing proper loading states
- Need to implement efficient data fetching

### Required Components
1. Navbar
- User dropdown with profile and logout
- Language switcher (en/ar)
- Responsive design

2. Profile Page
- Display user information
- Show roles and permissions
- Good styling with shadcn/ui components

3. Sidebar
- Enhanced styling from shadcn/ui
- Role-based menu items
- Mobile responsive

4. Forms
- Add proper validation
- Improve error handling
- Add loading states

### Role-based Access
- Middleware checks roles but needs enhancement
- Need to implement page-level access control
- Hide/show menu items based on permissions
- Improve permission verification

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 15 with TypeScript
- shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- Prisma for database
- JWT for authentication
- next-intl for i18n

## Performance Optimizations
- Implement proper data loading
- Add loading states
- Optimize database queries
- Improve API response times

## Security Improvements
- Fix permission system
- Enhance role-based access
- Improve error handling
- Add proper validation
